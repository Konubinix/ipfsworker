This is the code of the "ipfs companion" and the "ipfs controller" that I
refer to in [[https://konubinix.eu/braindump/posts/63b193f7-84d8-4ee0-8cb5-61146efd9703/?title=how_i_organize_my_static_files_with_ipfs_and_org_roam][how I organize my static files with IPFS and org-roam]].

The code of ipfsworker.py is the code of the "ipfs companion" while
ipfscontroller.py is the code of the "ipfs controller".

This is mostly ad-hoc, partially hardcoded code. It is not meant to be self
explicit or documented. It depends on a undocumented postgresql schema.

The only reason why I published it is that people generally ask to see this code
after reading my note. 

While not meant to be reused, it should at least give an idea of how one could
create per own tooling around ipfs.
